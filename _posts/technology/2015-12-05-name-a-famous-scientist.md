Many kids (and adults) can't name a famous, living engineer, scientist, or inventor. There is nothing wrong with having great superheroes from the world of sports and entertainment. But there should be more room for people who are contributing to society by curing diseases, creating breakthrough technologies, etc.

When you look at what we take for granted, no one knows how it got here. But, somehow we think it is remarkable that some guy can get the ball in the hoop at a slightly higher percentage than somebody else.
